# Foreign Key Relationship Fix Summary

## Issue
The error `PGRST200` indicated that there was no foreign key relationship between `organization_members` and `profiles` tables in the database schema.

## Root Cause
The Supabase queries were trying to use foreign key joins (`profiles!inner`) but the actual database schema doesn't have the expected foreign key relationships set up.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified Database Queries
**Before:**
```javascript
.select(`
  id,
  user_id,
  role,
  status,
  profiles!inner (
    id,
    email,
    full_name,
    avatar_url
  )
`)
```

**After:**
```javascript
.select(`
  id,
  user_id,
  role,
  status,
  invited_at,
  joined_at,
  department_id
`)
```

### 2. Updated Store Functions

#### fetchEmployees()
- Removed `profiles!inner` join
- Now returns basic organization member data
- Added `department_id` field

#### fetchInvitations()
- Removed `inviter:profiles!organization_invitations_invited_by_fkey` join
- Now returns `inviter_id` field only

#### fetchDepartments()
- Removed `manager:profiles!departments_manager_id_fkey` join
- Now returns `manager_id` field only

### 3. Updated UI Components

#### EmployeeManagement.jsx
- Updated filtering logic to work with simplified data
- Search now works with `user_id` instead of user details
- Updated EmployeeRow component to display user ID instead of name/email

#### EmployeeRow Component
- Displays `User {user_id_slice}` instead of actual user name
- Shows user ID instead of email
- Uses first 2 characters of user_id for avatar initials

### 4. Created Debug Tools

#### DatabaseDebug.jsx
- Test component to verify database table existence
- Checks `organization_members`, `organizations`, and `profiles` tables
- Provides detailed error information
- Shows sample data from each table

#### test_organization_members.sql
- SQL queries to check table structure
- Verifies foreign key constraints
- Checks data existence and structure

## Current Data Structure

### organization_members table
```javascript
{
  id: "uuid",
  user_id: "uuid", 
  organization_id: "uuid",
  role: "string",
  status: "string",
  invited_at: "timestamp",
  joined_at: "timestamp",
  department_id: "uuid"
}
```

### organizations table
```javascript
{
  id: "uuid",
  name: "string",
  domain: "string", 
  max_employees: "number",
  subscription_status: "string",
  subscription_end_date: "timestamp",
  created_at: "timestamp",
  updated_at: "timestamp",
  slug: "string",
  email: "string",
  created_by: "uuid"
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Database Schema
Run the SQL test queries to confirm:
- `organization_members` table exists
- `organizations` table exists  
- `profiles` table exists
- Foreign key relationships are properly set up

### 2. Set Up Proper Foreign Keys
If tables exist but foreign keys are missing, add them:

```sql
-- Add foreign key from organization_members to organizations
ALTER TABLE organization_members 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_organization_members_organization_id 
FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id);

-- Add foreign key from organization_members to profiles (if profiles table exists)
ALTER TABLE organization_members 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_organization_members_user_id 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES profiles(id);
```

### 3. Restore User Data Joins
Once foreign keys are properly set up, the queries can be updated to include user details:

```javascript
.select(`
  id,
  user_id,
  role,
  status,
  users!inner (
    id,
    email,
    user_metadata
  )
`)
```

### 4. Update UI to Show User Details
Once joins work, update EmployeeRow to show:
- User's actual name from `user_metadata.full_name`
- User's email address
- User's avatar if available

## Testing

1. **Use DatabaseDebug component** to test table existence
2. **Check browser console** for any remaining foreign key errors
3. **Test invitation flow** to ensure it works with simplified data
4. **Verify organization creation** works properly

## Temporary Workaround

The current implementation works with user IDs instead of user details. This is functional but not user-friendly. Once the database schema is properly set up with foreign keys, the joins can be restored for a better user experience.

## Files Modified

- `src/store/corporateStore.js` - Simplified all database queries
- `src/pages/corporate/EmployeeManagement.jsx` - Updated UI to handle simplified data
- `src/components/corporate/DatabaseDebug.jsx` - New debug component
- `test_organization_members.sql` - New SQL test file

The invitation system should now work without foreign key errors, though the user experience is temporarily limited until proper database relationships are established.
