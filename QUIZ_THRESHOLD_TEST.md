# Quiz Threshold Logic Test

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

The quiz completion logic is **already correctly implemented** to set `passed = true` when the user scores at or above the threshold.

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Score Calculation
```javascript
const percentage = maxScore > 0 ? Math.round((score / maxScore) * 100) : 0;
```

### 2. Threshold Check
```javascript
const passThreshold = quizData.pass_threshold || 70; // Uses quiz's threshold or defaults to 70%
const passed = percentage >= passThreshold; // true if percentage >= threshold
```

### 3. Database Storage
```javascript
// Stores in quiz_attempts table
{
  score: calculatedScore,
  max_score: totalQuestions,
  percentage: calculatedPercentage,
  passed: boolean, // true if passed threshold
  completed_at: timestamp
}
```

## 📊 Test Scenarios

| Quiz Score | Max Score | Percentage | Threshold | Passed |
|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|--------|
| 8 | 10 | 80% | 70% | ✅ true |
| 7 | 10 | 70% | 70% | ✅ true |
| 6 | 10 | 60% | 70% | ❌ false |
| 9 | 12 | 75% | 80% | ❌ false |
| 10 | 12 | 83% | 80% | ✅ true |

## 🎯 Key Features

1. **Flexible Thresholds**: Each quiz can have its own pass threshold
2. **Default Fallback**: Uses 70% if no threshold is set
3. **Accurate Calculation**: Proper percentage calculation with rounding
4. **Database Integration**: Stores completion status for persistence
5. **Visual Feedback**: UI updates based on passed status

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

1. **Create a quiz** with a specific pass threshold (e.g., 80%)
2. **Take the quiz** and score above the threshold
3. **Verify in console** that the log shows: `Passed: true`
4. **Check database** that `passed` column is set to `true`
5. **Verify UI** shows completion status and green styling

## 🔧 Debugging

The implementation includes console logging to help verify the logic:

```javascript
console.log(`Quiz completion check: Score ${score}/${maxScore} = ${percentage}%, Threshold: ${passThreshold}%, Passed: ${passed}`);
```

This will show in the browser console when a quiz is submitted.

## ✅ Conclusion

The quiz threshold logic is **already working correctly**. Users who score at or above the threshold will have `passed` set to `true`, and the lesson will be marked as completed automatically.
